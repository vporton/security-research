Hi,

This is a security bug report what I however decided to publish openly and distribute to as many people as possible, because I found no other choice.

You knowing security not worse than me should know that it happened that just one human broke the Internet at least two times:

    TLDs hack
    leftpad (you know what is leftpad, right?)

We have a similar security issue. It appears that I broke the world science... yeah, the entire academy of the Earth just like as someone once broke TLDs or the case with leftpad.

In addition, I broke Russia in the most severe way. (That's the second bug report.) While I regret that I broke world science, I mock and laugh at poor Russians and their President.

Please read the attached bug reports carefully and take an appropriate action. Response appreciated.
